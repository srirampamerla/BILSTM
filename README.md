# BILSTM- Bidirectional LSTMs 

BiLSTM: Extends LSTM by processing sequences forward and backward for better context.

By combining the outputs of both forward and backward LSTMs, BiLSTMs can capture contextual information from both past and future elements in the sequence. This provides a more comprehensive understanding of the sequence as a whole.

Enhanced Performance: BiLSTMs often outperform unidirectional LSTMs in various NLP tasks due to their ability to leverage richer contextual information.
